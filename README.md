# Project 2 - Create a Website

As our second project we chose to make a website about the legendary game Pokémon, in the hope that it might help some of these brave Pokémasters out there catching them alllllll.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine so that you can enjoy it.

### Prerequisites

You will need all the following elements installed:
- npm
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Installing

You don't want to get bored by the details? Then just click the following link: 

If you prefer having the game content on your computer and play it from there please follow the following steps.

1. Download the zipped Project2-master file
2. Unzip the file

### Opening the website

1. Double click on the unzipped Project2-master folder
2. From your terminal go to the unzipped folder
3. Run following command: npm install
4. Then this command: npm start run-dev
5. Open a web-browser page and write: http://localhost:3000 

## How to get started

Once you are on the login page you can either log in (if you already are a user) or click on the sign up text to fill in the required informations and be able to enjoy the website. Don't worry, you will not receive any emails. Once logged in you will be able to create a new pokemons in the New Pokémon tab on the top left, a new team in the Teams tab and then add the created pokemons to your team. 

When creating your pokémon, you can choose the species, the item it holds, it's ability and the distribution of it's IVs and EVs. All these changes will influence accordingly their stats, which will be displayed in the table on the right side. 
If you wish to edit an already created pokemon in the Pokémon tab you can click on the Edit buttom once you hoover over the pokemon image, or delete it by clicking the small red cross in the bottom right of the pokémon card.
To create a new team go to the Teams tab, enter a team name and click the Create button. Clicking the add button that appeared you can now add the previously created pokemons to your team. You can then click the Add button (that will appear under the pokemon image once your mouse is over it) once to add that pokemon to your team. You will not be redirected to the teams tab after adding a pokemon so that you may add multiple at the same time and we didn't implement a Add confirmation so remember to click only once, otherwise this pokemon will be added multiple times :).

Now you can create your own, unique pokemons so that you may build a perfectly balanced team that fits your needs.
